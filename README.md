# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Datasets
This repository is open for Hacktoberfest contributors to analyze data  and bring their opensource skills in action.

Social Datasets include -

- Indian Elections
- Air_Quality
- crime rates
- unemployment analysis


Medical Datasets -
- Liver Disease Dataset

Population -
- World Population
